# UNIL - Service Status Monitor

This project displays the status of internal and external web services for the University of Lausanne (UNIL).  
Developed as part of a technical challenge for CSE UNIL.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eugene-pascal/unil-de-lausanne.git
cd unil-de-lausanne
```

### 2. Copy the environment configuration

```bash
cp .env_copy .env
```

> The application uses **SQLite** by default.  
> It is set to`DB_CONNECTION=sqlite` .

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### 4. Run the database migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 5. Run the service status check

```bash
php artisan services:check
```

> You can add this command to your `cron` for automated periodic checks.

## Technical Overview

### Service Configuration

All services are defined in the config file:

```
config/services_status.php
```

Each service is described like this:

```php
'Compilatio' => [
    'url' => 'https://app.compilatio.net/api/public/alerts',
    'type' => 'json',
    'check' => [
        'param' => 'status.message',
        'value' => 'OK',
        'error' => 'data.alerts'
    ]
],
```

> This allows you to define which JSON response fields indicate success or failure.

###  Architecture

#### Models

- `app/Models/ServiceStatus.php` - stores history of checks
- `app/Models/ServiceFailure.php` - stores service downtime (failures)

#### Service check logic

Located in `app/Services/Checkers/`:

- `HtmlServiceChecker.php`
- `JsonServiceChecker.php`
- `SoapServiceChecker.php`
- `ServiceCheckerInterface.php`
- `ServiceCheckerFactory.php` - selects the appropriate checker based on service type

> This architecture is modular and easy to maintain and extend.

#### Uptime calculation

Implemented in `app/Services/Uptimes/ServiceCalculateUptimes.php`  
This class performs uptime calculations using models, but is fully decoupled from them â€” allowing for **flexible and reusable logic**.

---

### Status constants

Service statuses are defined using an enum:

```php
app/Enums/ServiceStatusEnum.php
```

> Improves code readability and reduces risk of typos.
